# Week 5
## Public UI Finalization and Admin Features

Building on the progress from previous weeks, **Week 5** was dedicated to finalizing the public-facing UI and laying the groundwork for robust admin content management. Our focus was on ensuring a seamless, responsive experience for all users and empowering administrators with intuitive tools for managing site content.

### Landing Page and Public UI

We completed the **landing page responsiveness**, ensuring a seamless user experience across all devices. This involved:

- Fine-tuning CSS for mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.
- Optimizing image loading and hero section performance.

The **mission and vision page** was finalized, with content structured for clarity and visual appeal. We also finished the **news and events section**, integrating dynamic content loading and ensuring consistent styling with the rest of the site.

### Admin CRUD and Content Management

This week marked the **initialization of the admin CRUD page** for managing:

- **News**
- **Officers**
- **Alumni association links**
- **Event management**

We designed and finished the **admin UI for managing the content of the donation page**, providing administrators with easy-to-use forms and validation feedback. The admin dashboard now allows for:

- Creating, editing, and deleting news/events.
- Managing officer profiles and alumni links.
- Updating donation information and call-to-action content.
